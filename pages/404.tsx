        You probably did this on purpose. Typing starscope.design is not that complicated. I'm gonna assume you know how to get back, but if not,{" "}<i>*hint* try the back button in your browser</i> ðŸ˜‰
      </p>
      <p className={styles.notFoundCopy}>
        Still struggling? There's a button that might work. I'm sure I left it around here somewhere, just keep moving your mouse around. Maybe you can find it.
